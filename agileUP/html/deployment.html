		beyond that of learning how to work with your application.&nbsp; For example, 
		this may be the first time that some users are working with a PC, a 
		browser, or even a mouse.&nbsp; Similarly, this may be the first time that 
		your operations staff is working with a new technology that your system 
		users, such as an EJB application server, and therefore will need to be 
		trained and educated in that technology to qualify them to work with 
		your system.&nbsp; </font> </p>

		will perform any required data conversion, which may be a one-time batch 
		job or a gradual conversion of the data as it is needed by your users.&nbsp; 
		You may decide to run your new system in parallel with your existing 
		system for several weeks to ensure that it actually works in production.&nbsp; 
		You may also choose to deploy your system to a subset of your user 
		community, called a pilot release, to verify that it runs for the 
		smaller group before you choose to &quot;inflict&quot; your system on everyone.&nbsp; 
		You may also need to deploy a version of your software to the support 
		department so they can simulate production problems when users contact 
		them for help.</font></p>
