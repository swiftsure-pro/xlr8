<p>
    There are different ways to approach this step, and much of the approach will depend on your project culture. Where
    available, gather and collate progress reports prepared by individual team members or sub-teams. Project time sheets
    are another possible source to consider. Where project scheduling systems such as Microsoft Project are actively used
    and updated with actual progress this provides another useful information source. Where available and actively used,
    you might also derive objective status or progress metrics from configuration and change management systems.&nbsp; Your
    measurement analyst should also provide analysis and recommendations specific to the test activities.
</p>
<p>
    For this step and subsequent steps that deal with gathering information and assessing the test effort, try to obtain a
    balanced view incorporating both objective and subjective measures. Remember that objective numbers only give part of
    the picture and need to be supported and explained by the current project "climate". Conversely, don't rely purely on
    hearsay and subjective speculation about the test effort: look for supporting objective evidence. We recommend you
    supplement your objective data by discussion with either team leads or where possible individual team members to gather
    subjective assessments and gauge how much confidence you can place in the objective data.

    The measurement analyst should provide initial analysis related to testing information needs.&nbsp; This can be
    combined with analysis from the test manager, along with subjective information from test logs or team members.&nbsp;
    Potential items that might be addressed include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        How much effort has been spent on the identification, definition, design, implementation and execution of tests
    </li>
    <li>
        Effectiveness of the testing such as defect discovery rate, defect severity counts, duplicate defect statistics,
        defects detected as test escapes
    </li>
    <li>
        Trends in change request data
    </li>
    <li>
        Trends in defects closures such as closures categorized as "not reproducible", insufficient analysis of the
        failure, trends that indicate defects awaiting verification by the test team are aging or growing to an
        unmanageable number
    </li>
    <li>
        Imbalances in defect distribution on different dimensions such as the application or specification, functional
        area, or team
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Once the test manager completes the analysis, recommendations should be considered and the selected alternative
    identified.&nbsp; This alternative should then be implemented, and the changes should be measured to ensure that the
    expected benefit is realized.

    Present your assessment for stakeholders to comment and offer feedback on. The format or method for doing this will
    differ from project to project: in some cases it will be a series of informal conversations, in another simply a
    posting on a project intranet web-site, and in others a formal presentation -- choose a format that suits your culture.
</p>
<p>
    Even with the best planning and specification documents possible, there will usually be differences between the
    original expectation and intent of those documents and the resulting end product. This is as true for testing and
    evaluating software as it is for the software development itself. The value of this step is to take the opportunity to
    elicit the stakeholders feedback and identify where the careful planning and documentation has not achieved what was
    originally expected or intended.

    Based on your analysis and the feedback you've received from various stakeholders, identify opportunities for
    improvement. Look for ways to make the testing more effective, productive and efficient. This might involve:
    reassigning staff, including pairing staff to work more effectively or employing specialized contractors; using
    productivity tools to improve efficiency; finding alternative approaches and techniques that are more productive in
    terms of finding defects.
</p>
<p>
    In most cases it's better to make small, incremental improvements to the test effort and avoid the risk of derailing
    the project with large, unsettling changes: In some cases a bigger change is warranted and useful. Use your best
    judgment to formulate an appropriate approach to improvement and discuss your ideas with other management staff to get
    their input before committing the team to embrace large changes.

    For the improvements to be effective, you will need to manage their success. Identify ways that you will be able to

    actively monitor the progress being made in adopting the changes yourself, or appoint someone else on the team to do
    so.

    Most changes meet resistance or problems that must be overcome for them to be ultimately successful. Allow time for and

    Now that you have completed the work, it is beneficial to verify that the work was of sufficient value, and that you
    did not simply consume vast quantities of paper. You should evaluate whether your work is of appropriate quality, and
    that it is complete enough to be useful to those team members who will make subsequent use of it as input to their
    work. Where possible, use the checklists provided in RUP to verify that quality and completeness are "good enough".
</p>
<p>
    Have the people performing the downstream activities that rely on your work as input take part in reviewing your
    interim work. Do this while you still have time available to take action to address their concerns. You should also
    evaluate your work against the key input artifacts to make sure you have represented them accurately and sufficiently.
    It may be useful to have the author of the input artifact review your work on this basis.
</p>
<p>
    Try to remember that that RUP is an iterative process and that in many cases artifacts evolve over time. As such, it is
    not usually necessary -- and is often counterproductive -- to fully-form an artifact that will only be partially used
    or will not be used at all in immediately subsequent work. This is because there is a high probability that the
    situation surrounding the artifact will change -- and the assumptions made when the artifact was created proven
    incorrect -- before the artifact is used, resulting in wasted effort and costly rework. Also avoid the trap of spending
    too many cycles on presentation to the detriment of content value. In project environments where presentation has
    importance and economic value as a project deliverable, you might want to consider using an administrative resource to
    perform presentation tasks.
